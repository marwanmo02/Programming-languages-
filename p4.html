The modern life depends on computers. And computer is run by something called computer program. 
The computer programs are made by programming languages, 
programming languages are the basis of all the comfort that you feel. 
Programming languages are responsible for the programs that have been created,  
scheduling software, rostering the systems, online games, virtual reality, anti-virus and etc. 
This programming languages brings one closer to understand how the digital technology has been created.
Programming languages ​​have different types of logical and expressions. 
Organizing rules that help to generate systematic and recurring tasks. 
They have a great importance because they allow generating different systems which serve the tasks that meet needs of users. 
There is great vary of this languages ​​and in any case they are oriented to different types of 
purposes, however, this multiple can be divided into two big groups, structured programming 
languages ​​and object-oriented languages. Approximately everything you can use in computer science is 
largely due to programming languages.
The computer allows us to calculate operations at high speed, However, it is completely 
	unusable if it were not for the programs which run on it.
This programs are one of various kinds, with the operating system probably the most important of all, 
the system in which different applications run. Programming languages are important for their development, 
each of them has special characteristics for its implementation. In addition to this, each programming language was written in turn with lower level, 
allowing a multiple of responses to existing needs. In other words, all programs are made in a clear flow, simple solutions are followed by more complex solutions, and so on, 
following the path that is conform to the evolving needs. It is worth remembering that every discipline comes from a simple understanding, so does the science of programming languages.
Like we have said, there are two big groups of programming languages, these with Organizer programming and these that are object oriented. At the first case the language consists of a set of instructions and orders as well as a group of rules of application thereof, propositional logic plays a main role in this case and all operations can be subject to logical relationships. In the case of an object-oriented programming language, at the other hand, there is an notion to reflect in the language different conditions of real existence, so, reference will be created to objects, inheritances, attributes, classes and etc. Programming languages ​​also can be divided between interpreted languages ​​and compiled languages, at the first case the language must be explained by another program, but in the second case it must be translated by means of the compiler, making in the process a file that is called executable.
The knowledge of programming language is very important to develop the abilities in terms of solving problems task automation. Certainly this type of knowledge linked with some basic notions of algorithms can open a whole new panorama of jobs
