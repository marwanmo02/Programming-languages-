A programming languages are formal languages contains a set of instructions that produce diffrent types of outputs.
Programming languages are used in computer programming to execute algorithms.
Hundreds of different programming languages have been created, and every year more are being created.
Programming languages make us able to give instructions to the computer in language the computer can understand. 
Like human languages exist, there are an array of programming languages that programmers can 
use to communicate with the computer.
 The part of the language that the computer understands is called binary. 
Translating programming languages into binary is called compiling.
Each programming language from C Language to Python language has its own special features, though many times there are many things in common 
between this programming languages.
This languages make computers able to quickly and efficiently process large and complex amounts of information.
For example, if a person is given a list of random numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and we asked him to place them in descending order,
	 usually that iwill take a big amount of time and include probablity of errors but with programming languages
	 that will take few seconds and with very high accuracy.
